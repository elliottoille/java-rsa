Had a math assignment that needed us to walk through RSA, I guess you were meant to just use wolfram alpha or some other software to generate the numbers at each step manually, but I decided to implement RSA in Java instead so I could print all the numbers I need to the terminal instead.  Very long process, helped me understand RSA like a god though, damn RSA expert over here.

We needed to do it for big numbers, numbers so big that I had to use java BigInteger which means the program looks horrible and unreadable because you have to do some BigInteger BS, 1 isn't just 1, it's BigInteger.ONE

While I was making it, I was like, GAHHH this program is so slow and I don't know why!!!! It takes way too long, if only there was some way to speed it up to make it usable.  Googled it, "HOLY CRAP, CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM" because we had learnt chinese remainder theorem earlier in the module, mind blown, you know when you're learning something and it doesn't seem to make any sense or be useful and then suddenly you do something later and realise everything you were taught was leading to this moment, and you get that beautiful revelation of how brilliant maths is.

Anyway, this program probably sucks, scratch that, it definitely sucks, but it does work.
